## What's included

StripeShop uses a standard MVC pattern file structure

```

```

## What I would like to add...

- I would like to add an "Orders" model. If a user is logged in when they make an order, the order would contain a reference to the user who made it. This would enable a user to see their previous orders

- It would be nice to bring in an authentication package like passport so a visitor could easily create an account and login from an existing Gmail or facebook account.

- Business logic needs to be added to orders.
