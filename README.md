## Quick start

To check out this app, you can clone a copy for yourself, or you can go [here]('https://www.google.com/')

- You dont need to create a user to explore the app. You can view products, add them to your cart, and checkout by sending a payment to [Stripe!](https://stripe.com/) Fake credit card details are provided on the checkout page for testing.
- You can also make your own user for demo purposes! Dont worry, there are no services on the backend that will actually send you any spam. By logging in, there are some more features you can explore:

  1. You can add a billing and shipping address for your user.
  2. You can update your billing and shipping information for your user.
  3. You can delete your user entirely.
  4. If you haven't signed up already, you will see a sign up for an email list on your user account page. Again, dont worry, this sign up doesn't actually do anything other than make an update to your user in the Database. That update will remove the email list sign up question from your user page the next time you log in.

- If you dont wish to create your own account, you can log in with the following credentials:

- As a normal user:

  - Username: testing12345
  - Password: Testing12345!

- As an admin user:
  - Username: testadmin123
  - Password: FakeFake123!
  - Once logged in as an Admin you can update products, remove products, and add products. You will see a new navbar underneath the normal one with the option to "add a product".

## Status

- There are a few more things I would like to do with this app, but I am early in my learning journey and want to move on to learning React for now. In the future I hope to add:
  - Business logic on the backend for inventory control when a purchase is made.
  - Adding a carousel for the "featured" products I think would be nice.
  - I want to add an "Orders" model that would store a user Id on it. If logged in users made a purchase, they could go to an "orders" page and view all of their previous orders.
  - True Image upload. For now, unplash image links are used for the images on the pages. I have experience with cloudinary, but did not want to dedicate too much time to the image portion of this project. I was also concerned with about what kind of images someone might upload if I opened it up too much. It is definitely an upgrade I am considering adding in the feature.
